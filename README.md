## General info
In this project, we used FER2013 dataset to accomplish the project and we used open cv harr cascade we've been able to detect  faces in the input image successfully.
## Background

Over the last few years, there is an increase in the desire to use deep learning tools to understand human behavior patterns. One of the most trendy challenges in this field is facial expression recognition. Facial expressions are a form of nonverbal communication. The immediate association when talking about human behavior is facial expression and, it's can tell us a lot about human emotions. The challenge is predicting the underlying image to one of seven different emotions (happiness, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, surprise, neutral).

## Architecture

The proposed architecture used for this work is further explained in the report

## Further development ideas

1. expand our work to more facial expression datasets.
2. Do more on preprocess and use pytorch  frame work

## Notes

- The data, and the predictor are too big to be uploaded to GitHub. [model link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1-4xKX3hGE67o-s_IbsMqfCS1JhhHL1z7/view?usp=sharing
  (for the raw images and the predictor you need to download the files and put them in a folder with the exact same name as in the original folder)
